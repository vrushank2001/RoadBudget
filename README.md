# RoadBudget
 RoadBudget is a Java-based desktop application designed to help users manage car-related expenses with ease. The application supports user registration and login with secure SHA-256 password hashing and salting. Users can register multiple cars, log individual expenses for each vehicle, and view all their transactions in a well-organized dashboard. The dashboard provides filtering by car, displays a detailed expense table including type, amount, date, description, and car name, and shows the total spending. RoadBudget ensures a user-friendly experience with a clean GUI built using Swing and supports date picking via an integrated calendar.
